# Testing

Testing the codebase under your active conda environment can be done simply by
running `pytest` at the top level directory.

If you want to run the test suite for _all_ the environments we need to
support, run the script `run_tests.py`.

If you want to create more environments to be tested with `run_tests.py`, just
create another conda environment spec file that matches the pattern
`environment*.yml`.
